## My classification Problem:
I chose to use a binary classification dataset of the titanic. This dataset contains their survival (0 = died, 1 = survived), ticket class, age, gender, ticekt, fare, cabin, and location. For my classification I only used age and fare as features. I thought that this would be an interesting and cool dataset to classify so I chose it!
